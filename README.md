# SpamtonBlock Origin

For those who would much rather have less shitposts in their supposedly-serious pack.
To be more specific: this resource pack currently alters the names of Thaumic Insurgence's items, as well as their research entries, for them to better fit with Thaumcraft and its dependencies. (An isolated easter egg is one thing. Lore-unfriendly shitposts, not so much.)

This is intended to be used with the Gregtech: New Horizons modpack, but it should function elsewhere.

## Before and After:

_Are you kidding me? What even is this?_ Also what's an 'azanor'? (yes I know it's base thaumcraft's dev, it just doesn't fit to see it in-character.)

_Wow. How very informative. Not._

Flavor text that actually fits the style? Who would come up with such a thing?

_Finally, a research entry that reads like a research entry rather than some meme copypasta._
